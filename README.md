Deadlock Concurrency is a repository containing examples and resources related to dealing with deadlocks in concurrent programs. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource they need. This repository aims to provide insights into detecting, preventing, and resolving deadlock situations in various concurrent programming scenarios.

## Introduction

Concurrent programming is becoming increasingly prevalent in modern software development to take advantage of multi-core processors and improve system performance. However, concurrent programs can be prone to deadlocks, which can lead to application failures and unpredictable behavior.

The Deadlock Concurrency repository addresses these challenges by offering sample code, documentation, and best practices for understanding and managing deadlocks in concurrent programs. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository can be a valuable resource in your journey to writing reliable concurrent applications.

## Features

- Code examples showcasing various deadlock scenarios.
- Documentation on how to identify potential deadlocks in your code.
- Strategies for preventing and resolving deadlocks in concurrent programs.
- Best practices for designing deadlock-free concurrent algorithms.

## Usage

To use the resources in this repository, you can either clone the entire repository or browse the specific files you are interested in. The code examples are written in [language of your choice] and can be run directly in your development environment.

## Examples

Here are some examples of scenarios covered in this repository:

1. **Resource Locking**: Demonstrates a simple case of deadlock where two or more threads contend for the same set of resources.

2. **Circular Dependency**: Shows how circular dependencies between threads can lead to deadlocks.

3. **Lock Ordering**: Discusses the importance of maintaining a consistent order while acquiring locks to avoid deadlocks.

4. **Timeout Strategies**: Provides examples of using timeouts to handle deadlock situations gracefully.
